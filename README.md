# kNN vs Naive Bayes Classifiers (Machine Learning Coursework)

This repository contains my ML midterm coursework comparing **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)** on classification tasks. The work includes data preprocessing, model training/evaluation, and discussion of results in a written report.

## Files in this repo
- **`ML_Midterms.ipynb`** — Full experimentation notebook (training, evaluation, plots).
- **`ML Notebook pdf.pdf`** — Coursework report (PDF write-up).

## What’s covered
- Comparison of **distance-based** vs **probabilistic** classification:
  - kNN
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Evaluation using standard classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision/recall, F1)
- Discussion of strengths/weaknesses and model behaviour across datasets

## How to view/run
### Option A — View on GitHub
Click `ML_Midterms.ipynb` to preview directly on GitHub.

> If GitHub fails to render the notebook (sometimes happens), use **nbviewer**:
1. Copy the notebook URL from GitHub
2. Paste it into: https://nbviewer.org/

### Option B — Run locally (Jupyter)
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/knn-vs-naive-bayes-classifiers.git
   cd knn-vs-naive-bayes-classifiers
